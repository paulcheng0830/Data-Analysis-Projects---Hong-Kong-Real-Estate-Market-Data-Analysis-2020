Introduction

The housing price of Hong Kong is one of the most common topics of local people. If you are interested in this topic and get a quick overview in this aspect, you don't need to read newspapers and finding a real property agent. Just click on the Internet, you may find much information about real property. 28 House is a great choice for you to grape this information. This project is to provide a dataset, analysis, and visualization for deeper investigation. The dataset was crawling from 28house.com in Dec 2020 and used for educational purposes only.
